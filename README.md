Overview
Individual project for the Numerical Statistics course at University of Bologna
(A.Y. 2023-24). Achieved top grade: 30/30.

Tech Stack
- Python 3.9
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
  
Pipeline
Dataset – sourced from Kaggle, loaded from CSV
Pre-processing – NaN removal, outlier detection, data cleaning
EDA – univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis, correlation matrix
Splitting – train/test split with stratification
Modelling – Logistic Regression vs SVM (linear, poly, RBF kernels)
Hyperparameter Tuning – grid search on C, kernel, degree, gamma
Evaluation – accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix
Statistical Analysis – k ≥ 10 repeated experiments, descriptive stats,
95% confidence intervals on mean accuracy
